Data mapped is for the relevant critical peak season (summer or winter) at each Zone Substation. Where a constraint occurs in both seasons, the season with the largest capacity shortfall over the time horizon is mapped.</p><p>This map allows the user to see the progression of load growth relative to distribution zone substation capacity over time, and understand areas of emerging capacity-related constraint. Note that capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the zone substation and as such this map provides an indicative ‘slice’ of the capacity situation through one level of the network. Also note that these images show available capacity before network or non-network options are taken to alleviate constraints, and before load transfer capability between adjacent zones have been taken into account.</p><p>This map does NOT show:</p><ul> <li><p>Areas facing power outage</li></p> <li><p>The capacity of the network to accept the connection of embedded or distributed generators</li></p></ul><p>The green and yellow colours indicate a period when zones that have sufficient spare capacity (available capacity is around or above zero), while the orange and red colours (where available capacity is below zero) indicate periods where zones facing capacity-related constraints where investment will be needed to ensure reliability is maintained.</p><p>Polygons shown are approximate Zone Substation service regions. Clicking on a specific region will reveal the details of that location and time period, including the season of constraint and the exact available capacity value for each year.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution zone substation region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul> <li><p><strong>Asset Type:</strong> Type of the network asset. Data presented in this layer is generally only for the Distribution Zone Substation level, although some businesses have smaller distribution feeder regions represented at times. These assets carry the following definitions:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Distribution Zone Substation (ZS):</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</li></p> <li><p><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distribution substations.</li></p> </ul> </li></p> <li><p><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.</li></p> <li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the asset or investment.</li></p> <li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</li></p> <li><p><strong>Demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the first 5-year horizon.</li></p> <li><p><strong>Data Currency:</strong> The most recent update of the shown data.</li></p> <li><p><strong>Next update:</strong> The expected date and source of the next update to the data.</li></p></ul><p>The table and chart shows the available capacity at the selected zone over the next ten years in MVA. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>summer critical asset</em>, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p>"

The value supplied is the estimated value of the preferred OPEX solution, and is aggregated into a single value for the investment year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other invest ($):</strong> Value of proposed network investment for each network asset, for investment that falls into any category apart from the above 4 categories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Total investment value ($):</strong> Total value of proposed network investment for the network asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deferrable amount ($):</strong> Amount of the total investment value that is potentially deferrable through the deployment of non-network options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investment year:</strong> Year when the proposed network investment will take place (financial year ending). Where investment will take place over multiple years, this corresponds only to the first year in which investment will take place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commitment Year:</strong> Year when the network business intends to commit on the investment and demand management will no longer be considered.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</p></li><li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the proposed investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potential value of 10 year deferral of investment:</strong> Potential net present value (NPV) if the investment is deferred for 10 years from the year of proposed investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the first 5-year horizon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reactive Support Requirement:</strong> Any support required for the asset in the form of reactive power indicated by the network business.</p></li></ul><p>The table and chart show the support required in MVA that would be needed to defer the proposed investment in one year.</p>"

This annual value can be thought of as an upper bound to the amount that the network could invest in equivalent non-network options (such as demand management or distributed generation) to alleviate a constraint for that year. If less than this upper bound is spent addressing the constraint using non-network options, then overall the cost to network service providers and consumers is lower.</p><p>Annual Deferral Values are indicative estimates which are subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done. <strong>Annual Deferral Values are not what the Network Service Provider is willing to pay for demand management support.</strong> Refer to the Network Service Provider’s Demand Side Engagement Document for details on how they assess non-network solutions and determine payment levels.</p><p>Areas in white are those with no deferral value. Areas in light yellow and brown are those with limited deferral value where very low cost demand management options may be viable. Annual deferral value increases strongly in the red to purple areas (&gt;$400/kVA/yr).</p><p>Annual deferral value is calculated by determining the annualised value of deferring the network solution (avoided depreciation and interest paid on capital), and dividing this by the amount of network support (in kVA) that would be required in that year to achieve the deferral. Note that while the $/kVA/yr figure shown is a marginal value (i.e. for each kVA of capacity supplied), a whole year’s the demand growth is generally required in network support to enable a successful deferral to be achieved. That is, a sufficiently large quantum of network support is required.</p><p>Note that where 2025 data (for example) is shown for a <em>winter critical</em> asset, this is for the winter occurring in the middle of 2025. Where 2025 data is shown for a <em>summer critical</em> asset, this is for the summer season bridging 2024/25.</p><p>From the investment year onwards the ADV shrinks if load growth is forecast to continue, as the amount of support required continues to increase, but the annualised value of depreciation and cost of capital remain unchanged. As such, the most lucrative time to invest in demand management tends to be the year of proposed investment.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box.

However, the peak demand of a network asset generally occurs only a few hours a year and hence it is useful to show the timing and magnitude of the constrained hours on a representative the peak day.</p><p>This map layer shows the load as percentage of asset capacity for each hour of a representative peak day in the lowest level of the network each area with potentially deferrable investment. For example, if the zone substation has deferrable value then the zone exceedance situation is mapped, while if the only deferrable value is at the transmission level, the transmission exceedance situation is mapped.</p><p>A value &lt; 100% represents spare capacity, while a value &gt; 100% represents an exceedance.</p><p>Note that the critical season (summer or winter) and year of investment is different for each constraint area. As such, the peak day data mapped for each area is for the planned investment year* and the relevant peak season. This means that winter peaking zones may be more likely to show exceedance early and late in the day, and summer peaking zones to show value during the middle of the day and afternoon.</p><p>In the additional information (when a polygon is clicked), the values are graphed to show the peak day load trace.</p><p>* If the first year that support is required is after the investment year, then the exceedance for this year is mapped.</p><p>When the user clicks on the distribution feeder region, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Asset type:</strong> Type of network asset according with the following definitions:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transmission Line:</strong> High voltage power lines (including switching stations) built and operated by the transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transmission Terminal Station:</strong> High voltage transformation substation built and operated by transmission network service provider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission line:</strong> Sub transmission power line connecting transmission station and zone substation assets generally built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sub transmission Substation:</strong> Transformation substation at the sub transmission voltage levels built and operated by transmission network service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Zone Substation:</strong> Transformation substation typically (but not exclusively) converting voltage to 11kV on the low voltage side, built and operated by distribution network service providers.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Distribution Feeder (DF):</strong> Medium or high voltage feeder (e.g. 22 kV or 11 kV) emerging from the ZS to distribute power to downstream smaller, local distributions substations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Network:</strong> Name of the Network Service Provider that manages the asset.</p></li><li><p><strong>Notes:</strong> Additional information on the proposed investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraint Season(s):</strong> Primary season of constraint driving network investment (Summer, Winter, Spring and/or Autumn).</p></li><li><p><strong>Peak day load shape used:</strong> Specific date from which peak day load shape was extracted. This is when single half-hourly maximum demand occurred within the available load data sample. Note that this is automated from raw half-hourly data and can sometimes represent data anomalies. For more detail on how this load shape is adjusted see calculation examples on ENA Webpage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Demand growth rate (MVA/yr):</strong> Average demand growth rate for the asset over the first 5-year horizon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proposed investment year:</strong> Financial year when the investment takes place. Where investment takes place over multiple years, this field shows the first year in which the investment takes place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset capacity (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity at which the NSP is comfortable operating the network asset over the coming 10-year period. This may be the secure capacity, the nameplate capacity, or some other customisable level that could change year on year.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mapped year:</strong> Year shown in the map which coincides with the planned year of investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maximum capacity exceedance in mapped year (MVA):</strong> Maximum capacity exceedance in the constrained asset expected for the mapped year.</p></li><li><p><strong>MWh exceedance in</strong> <strong>shown year (MWh):</strong> Total forecast energy exceedance in MWh for the mapped year.</p></li></ul><p>NOTE:</p><ul><li><p>The above data is repeated for other constrained assets at higher levels of the network (where data is available)</p></li><li><p>Peak day hourly data supplied is generally raw, unchecked and uncorrected for load transfers that occurred during the period. Anomalies may exist.</p></li><li><p>The peak day date in the graphs for all polygons is shown as “1/1/1900” to ensure it is not confused for data from a specific actual date.</p></li></ul>"

Each NSP can assist proponents to make informed investment decisions by providing more detailed and project-specific capacity and congestion information as part of a connection enquiry. Each NSP encourages interested parties to contact the appropriate Business Development or Connections team by using the contact details listed in the detailed information for each asset. </p><p>Interested parties are also encouraged to refer to the Transmission Annual Planning Report for each NSP, which provides additional information relevant to the development of new generation projects.</p><p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>The grey tranmission line underlay has been adapted for visual appearance consistency with the maps of 'New generation connection capacity' by Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) as part of the 'Network Opportunity' maps. The original dataset was obtained from Geoscience Australia, ©Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2015. It was adapted in 2017 under the Creative Commons license by the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>It is each left to each individual NSP to determine whether their contribution to this dataset only includes substation elements (points), or also includes powerlines (lines), where powerlines are not presently included for a particular area, they may be included in a later update.</p><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

Each NSP can assist proponents to make informed investment decisions by providing more detailed and project-specific capacity and congestion information as part of a connection enquiry. Each NSP encourages interested parties to contact the appropriate Business Development or Connections team by using the contact details listed in the detailed information for each asset. </p><p>Interested parties are also encouraged to refer to the Transmission Annual Planning Report for each NSP, which provides additional information relevant to the development of new generation projects.</p><p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p><p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p><p>The grey tranmission line underlay has been adapted for visual appearance consistency with the maps of 'New generation connection capacity' by Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) as part of the 'Network Opportunity' maps. The original dataset was obtained from Geoscience Australia, ©Commonwealth of Australia (Geoscience Australia) 2015. It was adapted in 2017 under the Creative Commons license by the Institute of Sustainable Futures (ISF) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).</p><p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p><ul>  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li></ul><p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p><ul>  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li></ul><p>It is each left to each individual NSP to determine whether their contribution to this dataset only includes substation elements (points), or also includes powerlines (lines), where powerlines are not presently included for a particular area, they may be included in a later update.</p><p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These are generally not considered prospective areas for new generator connections, and may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p><p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p><p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p><p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p><p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p><p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p><p>An explanation of the additional information is given below:</p><ul>  <li>    <b>Asset name:</b> Full asset name used by the Network Service Provider.  </li>  <li>    <b>Owner:</b> Name of the Network Service Provider manages the asset.  </li>  <li>    <b>Asset Type:</b> Type of the network asset.

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Only those sub-sectors that are significant organic waste generators within the Manufacturing division have been considered. This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation. This includes the following:<ul><li>Cattle processing</li><li>Pork processing</li><li>Chicken processing</li><li>Dairy product processing</li><li>Wine production</li></ul><p>To determine the locations of major facilities at Local Government Area (LGA) level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised. The NPI Guide Version 6.1, September 2015 provides the overarching requirements for industries and threshold trigger requirements. Most of the facilities within the scope of this assessment produce high strength wastewaters with high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, which is a trigger that will see their inclusion on the NPI list. Industry-wide generation rates for relevant organic waste streams were derived based on the number of employees, desktop research and consultation with industry.</p><p>Only those facilities that trigger the requirement for NPI reporting were included.  These were large facilities producing significant quantities of wastewater i.e. organisations employing 200 + staff or large industrial facilities. There is a gap around facilities operated by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which employ between 20 to 199 staff. This gap has been identified where possible, addressed where enough information has been available, or highlighted as an area of potential further analysis as part of the continuation of this project.</p><p>The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.</p><p>For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au.</p><p>If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.</p>",

The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organic waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746.

(2008), Greaves & May (2012) and information provided by various plantation growers for softwood and hardwood species.  Residues were separated into the following categories:<ul><li>Stump</li><li>Bark</li><li>Branches (>5 cm)</li><li>Twigs (< 5 cm) branches and foliage (all assumed to be left on site)</li></ul></p><p>A proportion of each residue type (ranging from 0% for stumps to 100% for small branches and foliage) was assumed to be unavailable due to difficulty in collection and/or the need to conserve nutrients on site.</p>",

The reason for the later time period used for plantation log supply was the sharp increase in plantation log production over time.Since many sawlogs produced from Victorian forests are processed in other states or exported overseas, the proportion of residues processed in Victoria was estimated from the ratio between total amount of sawn timber produced across the state for the period 2011-15 and the expected total production of sawn timber from plantations and native forests over the same period based on the total number of sawlogs produced and sawn timber recovery rates (Gavran 2014).  This statewide data was distributed at an LGA level using spatial data showing the locations of plantations (ABARES 2016b) and regional production data provided by Vicforests (M. Lawrence Pers. Comm.).</p><p>Total sawmill residues were estimated from the number of sawlogs processed using results Gavran et al. (2014) and were converted from volumes to dry mass using wood densities sourced from Illic et al. (2000).  These totals were divided into the following residue categories using proportions estimated by Greaves and May (2014):<ul><li>Woodchips</li><li>Sawdust and shavings</li><li>Bark</li></ul></p><p>It should be noted that most sawmill residues are currently utilised. Wood chips are mostly used for pulp and paper production (either locally or exported overseas), sawdust and shavings are burnt for heat production to kiln dry timber, and bark and sawdust are sold for potting mix or animal bedding.</p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

Due to the prominent use of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) datasets across this study, data has been presented at Statistical Area 2 level (SA2),an Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) that is part of  the ABS geographical framework for collection and dissemination of geographically classified statistics. SA2s are general-purpose medium sized areas, representing a community that interacts together socially and economically and generally have a population range of 3,000 to 25,000 persons. They can be linked to LGAs through correspondence tables that ABS provides. </p> <p> The categorisation of wastes has considered the end nature of the wastes to be used in energy production. Therefore, an indication of whether a residue is dry, wet, liquid or woody has been provided where possible. They have been discussed below. </p> <p> Dry and woody feed: For consistency, data has where possible been provided in dry tonnes per annum, taking into consideration the moisture content of residue streams, or left as tonnes per annum where application of a moisture content is not feasible due to the inconsistent nature of the organics waste stream or data. </p> <p> Wet feed: Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is a measure of the total organic compounds in water  by providing an indication of the total oxygen required to fully oxidise those compounds. COD differs from Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) in that it considers organic matter than can be chemical oxidised and not just biologically. COD therefore includes more organic compounds (than BOD), and is commonly used for testing industrial wastewaters, a key output from most commercial facilities. COD is also used to predict the potential for biogas production and the COD present in organic material is essentially preserved in the AD end products of methane and digestate residue mass. Hence, where wastewater have been modelled, the residues have been provided in COD tonnes per year. </p> <p> Liquid feed: Compared to wastewater, the main component contributing to the organic strength of sludge and manure is organic Suspended Solids (SS). From an energy generation perspective, the most important metrics in characterising these slurries are Total Solids content (TS) and Volatile Solids content (VS), rather than COD. When considering biogas production from a slurry, the VS content is more important than TS as it represents the fraction of the solid material that may be transferred to biogas. Hence, quantities of residue from manures or slurries have been presented in VS tonnes per year. </p> <p> The types of residues modelled are based on an assessment of the availability of the stream, such as where the current offtake markets have little value or disposal costs are low. </p> <p> For more information on the modelling methodology, or if you are a generator and would like to provide feedback to improve the assumptions, please contact Kelly Wickham at kelly.wickham@sustainability.vic.gov.au. </p> <p> If you have queries about using the data for your project or would like more information about how Sustainability Victoria may be able to assist you, please contact the Investment Facilitation Services team at invest@sustainability.vic.gov.au, +61 3 8626 8746. </p>",

The Atlas provides interactive maps of wave and tidal energy resources for Australia’s marine estate, with further available information on supporting infrastructure and spatial constraints in the marine domain. The Atlas compiles output from several projects. Notably the CSIRO led Australian Wave Energy Atlas Project, and the University of Tasmania led Australian Tidal Energy (AUSTEn) project, both supported by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), building on prior CSIRO assessments of Australia's marine energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of potential marine energy projects. The online Atlas has used data from weather mapping, satellites, in-situ measuring stations and a variety of other sources, which have supported development of marine and hydrodynamic modelling applications.</p><p>The online Atlas has 3 main components:<ol><li>Multiple use layers - which contains geographic information on other uses of the marine domain, including supporting, complementary and potentially competing requirements (e.g., Ports, Shipping and Fishing information);</li><li>Wave Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s wave energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation;</li><li>Tidal Energy Resource - includes geographic layers reflecting characteristics of Australia’s tidal energy resource, and analysis tools for further data interrogation.</li></ol></p><p>The analysis tools of the Australian Marine Energy Atlas provides unique functionality in AREMI. Below are the steps to access and query the Atlas information:<ul><li>Click on 'Analysis Tools' and then scroll down to select a type of analysis;</li><li>Once the type of analysis has been selected, to enable a query, a location needs to be selected; either by clicking on point within the 'Analysis Study Area' highlighted in grey or by typing the exact lat/long;</li><li>Once the location point has been selected, click on 'Run Analysis'; an image with the analysis results will appear in the workbench.</li></ul></p>",

The PSMA , an unlisted public company owned by Australia’s Federal, State and Local Governments, has produced the first comprehensive census of Australia’s buildings. The APVI has undertaken firstof-kind studies to generate detailed estimates of solar potential within Australian cities. The methodologies to estimate the potential for rooftop solar power in Australia combines both of these datasets. \n - a top-down estimate of available roof space generated by OMNILINK using the PSMA Geoscape database which has mapped over 96 per cent of Australian buildings; and \n - a bottom-up estimate of solar potential applying the data from detailed studies in five inner-city areas undertaken by UNSW for the APVI across other LGAs. NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM) was used to estimate the annual energy generated by the potential PV capacity. The model inputs include irradiance and temperature for a reference meteorological year (derived from weather data collected at the nearest of 196 BOM weather stations), tilt and orientation (assuming 90% of usable residential roofs and 10% of other usable roofs are pitched at 25° and evenly distributed between all northerly orientations, with remaining roofs being flat) and shading characteristics from the GIS modelling, with a derating factor of 0.77 to account for electrical efficiency losses, soiling, degradation etc."

The digital boundary files are from Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Volume 3 - Non ABS Structures (cat no. 1270.0.55.003). The planning zones are categorised as per the Geoscape database in 12 generic categories. State planning zones vary significantly so they are mapped against these 12 generic codes to create a uniform categorisation across the country. This layer highlights the potential and energy output for the five major planning zones. \n - Residential  \n - Commercial \n - Industrial \n - Rural / Primary production \n - Mixed use \n\n  The PSMA, an unlisted public company owned by Australia’s Federal, State and Local Governments, has produced the first comprehensive census of Australia’s buildings. The APVI has undertaken first-of-kind studies to generate detailed estimates of solar potential within Australian cities. The methodologies to estimate the potential for rooftop solar power in Australia combines both of these datasets. \n - a top-down estimate of available roof space generated by OMNILINK using the PSMA Geoscape database which has mapped over 96 per cent of Australian buildings; and \n - a bottom-up estimate of solar potential applying the data from detailed studies in five inner-city areas undertaken by UNSW for the APVI across other LGAs. \n\n NREL’s System Advisor Model (SAM) was used to estimate the annual energy generated by the potential PV capacity. The model inputs include irradiance and temperature for a reference meteorological year (derived from weather data collected at the nearest of 196 BOM weather stations), tilt and orientation (assuming 90% of usable residential roofs and 10% of other usable roofs are pitched at 25° and evenly distributed between all northerly orientations, with remaining roofs being flat) and shading characteristics from the GIS modelling, with a derating factor of 0.77 to account for electrical efficiency losses, soiling, degradation etc."

As part of the processing an intermediate output is the SSHO data. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day.

The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:<p><a href='https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/'>https://github.com/NICTA/aremi-tmy/</a><p>As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.<p>After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.<p>In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.<p>The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package. The label of each LIB file gives the latitude and longitude (WGS84 datum) location of the 5 km resolution grid cell result which was used to generate the LIB file, as outlined in the example below.<em>Australia_5km_9.856S_142.310E.lib</em>Each LIB file contains the wind speed frequency distribution, as Weibull-A and Weibull-k parameters, for 12 directional sectors, 5 roughness classes and 5 standard heights.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package. The label of each LIB file gives the latitude and longitude (WGS84 datum) location of the 5 km resolution grid cell result which was used to generate the LIB file, as outlined in the example below.<em>Australia_5km_9.856S_142.310E.lib</em>Each LIB file contains the wind speed frequency distribution, as Weibull-A and Weibull-k parameters, for 12 directional sectors, 5 roughness classes and 5 standard heights.

WAsP is an industry standard microscale model that was developed for the creating of the European Wind Atlas (Troen and Petersen, 1989).<p>WAsP LIB files contain generalised climate wind statistics which are expressed as wind speed and wind direction frequency distributions for standard heights and surface roughness lengths. The LIB files can therefore be used, along with the WAsP microscale wind flow modelling software, to generate finer resolution wind speed maps across an area of interest. These finer resolution maps could then be used for the purpose of site identification studies, or preliminary turbine siting studies.<p>Download all the DNV GL WAsP LIB files:<br/><a target='_blank' href='http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip'>http://static.aremi.data61.io/datasets/DNVGL/Australia_5km_libfiles_all.zip</a><p>The hourly outputs of the WMS at 25 km horizontal intervals in the study domain are used to calculate the generalized wind climate statistics. This was performed using the Danish Technical University (DTU) Generalized Wind Climate software package. The label of each LIB file gives the latitude and longitude (WGS84 datum) location of the 5 km resolution grid cell result which was used to generate the LIB file, as outlined in the example below.<em>Australia_5km_9.856S_142.310E.lib</em>Each LIB file contains the wind speed frequency distribution, as Weibull-A and Weibull-k parameters, for 12 directional sectors, 5 roughness classes and 5 standard heights.

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - summer evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter afternoon and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

Assistance and advice was provided by IT Power. Network partners Ergon Energy in Queensland, Essential Energy and Transgrid in NSW, ElectraNet and SA Power Networks in South Australia, and SP AusNet and Powercor in Victoria, also collaborated on the project and assisted with data provision.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The project was funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Ergon Energy and AUSTELA.  The project’s final report was issued in 2013 and it is available at: [http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/documents/Breakingthesolargridlock_finalv2.pdf)<br/><br/>The project analyses and maps potentially avoidable network investment and locations where Concentrating Solar Thermal Power (CSP) can address network constraints.<br/><br/>This project investigated whether network support payments for installing CSP at grid constrained locations in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) could bridge the cost gap for CSP, while achieving societal savings in the costs of addressing network constraints. The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/>This map series shows the “Indicative Firm Capacity” (IFC) of CSP plants with different levels of thermal storage for pick period - winter evening and six storage scenarios (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 hours). <br/><br/>The IFC is essentially an estimate of the probability that CSP with storage would be generating during the key summer and winter peak network constraint periods. To derive the IFC, twenty-one of the highest peak demand events for each state in each of the defined peak time periods during 2009, 2010, and 2011 were selected. It was then modelled whether CSP, with thermal storage configurations varying from 0 to 15 hours, would have been generating during the peak event. An IFC of 0.9 (red areas) indicates that for that peak period, a CSP plant with the number of hours thermal storage selected, would have been generating power during at least 90% of those peak events.<br/><br/>Note that coastal areas have lower values due to the weather systems that generally prevail on the coast. This is also true for tropical northern Queensland, where summers include monsoonal impacts and periods of high rainfall. In winter, Queensland sees higher IFCs because of the absence of monsoonal weather patterns. Also note that IFCs are somewhat higher the further west the plant is located (e.g. northern South Australia).<br/><br/>This modelling shows that IFCs in excess of 80% can be achieved in all seasons and most locations.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps: <br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-2a-0hr.html)"

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints. The study identified $0.8 billion of potentially avoidable network investment, and 533 MW of cost effective CSP which could be installed at grid constrained locations in the next 10 years. This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/><strong>These maps</strong> indicate that CSP could avoid the need for network augmentation in 48 locations, or 72% of the constrained locations examined. If only locations with solar resources better than 21 MJ/m2/day DNI are included, CSP could avoid the need for augmentation at 94% of locations.<ul><li>The coloured shapes mark the grid constraints in areas where the solar resource is sufficiently high to warrant the investigation of CSP. A <strong>circle</strong> shows that CSP is able to meet the network constraint; a <strong>square</strong> that CSP cannot meet the constraint; and a <strong>triangle</strong> is where there is insufficient information to reach a conclusion.</li><li>The colour of the shape indicates the CSP cost-gap <emph>after</emph> taking into account a network support payment. Green areas are where the modelling indicates a positive CSP business case, while red indicates a substantial cost-gap.</li><li>The size of the circle is proportional to the most cost effective plant capital cost</li><li>Clicking on a shape gives detailed information.</li></ul><br/><br/>Altogether, installation of 533MW of CSP at grid constrained locations was found to be cost effective during the next 10 years, and an additional 125MW had a cost benefit greater than -$20/MWh. Installation of this CSP would save approximately 1.9 MT of greenhouse gases per year.<br/><br/>For more information about the project and data used for generating the maps:<br/><br/>[http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-3a.html](http://breakingthesolargridlock.net/maps/map-3a.html)"

The project quantifies the potential economic benefits from installing CSP at grid constrained locations, and maps where CSP could provide cost-effective network support services.<br/><br/>The project found that CSP can offer a commercially viable alternative to traditional network augmentation solutions in addressing electricity grid constraints.

This would reduce greenhouse emissions by 1.9 million tonnes per year.<br/><br/><strong>These maps</strong> indicate that CSP could avoid the need for network augmentation in 48 locations, or 72% of the constrained locations examined.

These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018). <p/> The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The concepts of the Observed Tidal Range (OTR), and Highest and Lowest Observed Tide (HOT, LOT) are discussed and described fully in Sagar et al. (2017) and the product description for the ITEM v 1.0 product (Geoscience Australia, 2016)."

They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime. <p/> The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artefacts. <p/> The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. The tide stages were calculated by comparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide. <p/> Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band)."

Tidal modelling on self-similar coastal polygons was performed to minimise regional uncertainty. <p/> Accuracies and limitations related to geomedian compositing of observations are discussed in Roberts et al (2017). <p/> Users should beware of seasonal and diurnal effects in the imagery, especially in the north east of Australia where the footprint of the highest and lowest astronomical tides are large. Consequently, where image acquisition misses the highest astronomical tide, for example, pooling effects of water are still visible in the landscape in lowest observed tidal composite imagery. <p/> This product has been rendered in both true colour and false colour. Validation and interpretation of surface features has not been attempted here. Interpretation of surface features is at the users own discretion."

The current version (2.0) utilises all Landsat observations (5, 7, and 8) for Australian coastal regions (excluding off-shore Territories) between 1986 and 2016 (inclusive). <p/> ITEM v2.0 has implemented an improved tidal modelling framework (see Sagar et al. 2018) over that utilised in ITEM v1.0. The expanded Landsat archive within the Digital Earth Australia (DEA) has also enabled the model extent to be increased to cover a number of offshore reefs, including the full Great Barrier Reef and southern sections of the Torres Strait Islands. The DEA archive and new tidal modelling framework has improved the coverage and quality of the ITEM v2.0 relative extents model, particularly in regions where AGDC cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0 produced discontinuities or the imposed v1.0 cell structure resulted in poor quality tidal modelling (see Sagar et al. 2017). <p/> Examples of regions in ITEM v2.0 where these significant improvements have been noted include: <ul> <li>Dampier Peninsula and King Sound, WA. Improved modelling within King Sound has removed the discontinuities seen at cell boundaries in ITEM v1.0, and expanded the extent of intertidal region being mapped. </li> <li>Tiwi Islands, Coburg Peninsula and Croker Island, NT. Poor spatial representation of the regions tidal regimes in ITEM v1.0 has been improved in v2.0 resulting in extensive onshore reefs and mudflats now being mapped. </li> <li>The full Great Barrier Reef has been mapped, detailing reef structures which expose at low tide. Algorithm amendments have reduced the false positive exposed surface detections resulting from glint and sun glitter. </li> <li>Broad Sound, QLD. Improved tidal modelling has resulted in a smoother intertidal extent map, and a greatly improved confidence layer value for the region. </li> <li>Improvements in the coverage of the DEA archive has allowed many regions unresolved in ITEM v1.0 and showing as 'no data' to be modelled successfully in ITEM 2.0.

Hence, terminology has been adopted for the product to reflect the highest modelled tide observed in a given cell (HOT) and the lowest modelled tide observed (LOT) (see Sagar et al. 2017). These measures are relative to Mean Sea Level, and have no consistent relationship to Lowest (LAT) and Highest Astronomical Tide (HAT). <p/> The inclusion of the lowest (LMT) and highest (HMT) modelled tide values for each tidal polygon indicates the highest and lowest tides modelled for that location across the full time series by the OTPS model. The relative difference between the LOT and LMT (and HOT and HMT) heights gives an indication of the extent of the tidal range represented in the Relative Extents Model. <p/> As in ITEM v1.0, v2.0 contains some false positive land detection in open ocean regions. These are a function of the lack of data at the extremes of the observed tidal range, and features like glint and undetected cloud in these data poor regions/intervals. <p/> Methods to isolate and remove these features are in development for future versions. Issues in the DEA archive and data noise in the Esperance, WA region off Cape Le Grande and Cape Arid (Polygons 236,201,301) has resulted in significant artefacts in the model, and use of the model in this area is not recommended. <p/> The Confidence layer is designed to assess the reliability of the Relative Extent Model. Within each tidal range percentile interval, the pixel-based standard deviation of the NDWI values for all observations in the interval subset is calculated. The average standard deviation across all tidal range intervals is then calculated and retained as a quality indicator in this product layer. <p/> The Confidence Layer reflects the pixel based consistency of the NDWI values within each subset of observations, based on the tidal range. Higher standard deviation values indicate water classification changes not based on the tidal cycle, and hence lower confidence in the extent model. <p/> Possible drivers of these changes include: <ol> <li>Inadequacies of the tidal model, due perhaps to complex coastal bathymetry or estuarine structures not captured in the model. These effects have been reduced in ITEM v2.0 compared to previous versions, through the use of an improved tidal modelling framework </li> <li>Change in the structure and exposure of water/non-water features NOT driven by tidal variation. For example, movement of sand banks in estuaries, construction of man-made features (ports etc.).</li> <li>Terrestrial/Inland water features not influenced by the tidal cycle.</li> </ol>"

These products have been produced using Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The two mosaics allow cloud free and noise reduced visualisation of the shallow water and inter-tidal coastal regions of Australia, as observed at high and low tide respectively (Sagar et al. 2018). <p/> The composites are generated utilising the geomedian approach of Roberts et al (2017) to ensure a valid surface reflectance spectra suitable for uses such as habitat mapping. The time range used for composite generation in each polygon of the mosaic is tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated.

They are highly changeable environments, subject to forcings from the land, sea and atmosphere and yet they form critical habitats for a wide range of organisms from birds to fish and sea grass. By harnessing the long archive of satellite imagery over Australia's coastal zones in the DEA and pairing the images with regional tidal modelling, the archive can be sorted by tide height rather than date, enabling the inter-tidal zone to be viewed at any stage of the tide regime. <p/> The High Low Tide Composites (HLTC_25) product is composed of two mosaics, distinguished by tide height, representing a composite image of the synthetic geomedian surface reflectance from Landsats 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI NBAR data (Li et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2017). Oregon State Tidal Prediction (OTPS) software (Egbert and Erofeeva, 2002, 2010) was used to generate tide heights, relative to mean sea level, for the Australian continental coastline, split into 306 distinct tidal regions. These time and date stamped tidal values were then attributed to all coastal tile observations for their time of acquisition, creating a range of observed tide heights for the Australian coastline. The two mosaics in HLTC_25 are composited from the highest and lowest 20 % of observed tide in the ensemble and are termed HOT and LOT respectively. A geomedian composite for each Landsat band is calculated from the tiles in each ensemble subset to produce the respective HOT and LOT composites. Note that Landsat 7 ETM+ observations are excluded after May 2003 due to a large number of data artefacts. <p/> The time range used for composite generation in each of the 306 polygons of the mosaics are tailored to ensure dynamic coastal features are captured whilst still allowing a clean and cloud free composite to be generated. The maximum epoch for which the products are calculated is between 1995-2017, although this varies due to data resolution and observation quality. The product also includes a count of clear observations per pixel for both mosaics and attribute summaries per polygon that include the date range, the highest and lowest modeled astronomical tide as well as the highest and lowest observed tide for that time range, the total observation count and the maximum count of observations for any one pixel in the polygon, the polygon ID number (from 1 to 306), the polygon centroid in longitude and latitude and the count of tide stages attributed to every observation used in that polygon of the mosaic. For the count of tidal stage observations, e = ebbing tide, f = flowing tide, ph = peak high tide and pl = peak low tide. The tide stages were calculated by comparison to the modeled tide data for 15 minutes either side of the observation to determine the ebb, flow or peak movement of the tide. <p/> Observations are filtered to remove poor quality observations including cloud, cloud shadow and band saturation (of any band)."

Consequently, where image acquisition misses the highest astronomical tide, for example, pooling effects of water are still visible in the landscape in lowest observed tidal composite imagery. <p/> This product has been rendered in both true colour and false colour.

The project results were twofold:<ol><li>users have now access to terrain corrected surface reflectance from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 presented as true colour and false colour composites and</li><li>all applications using the open source terriaJS have the “screen splitter” and “date picker” functionalities developed, allowing users to make comparisons of imagery for different points in time.</li></ol></p><center><img style='padding: 10px' height='100px' src='/proxy/_1s/http://static.nationalmap.nicta.com.au/images/DEA.jpg'/><img style='padding: 10px' height='100px' src='/proxy/_1s/http://static.nationalmap.nicta.com.au/images/Data61.png'/><img style='padding: 10px' height='100px' src='/proxy/_1s/http://static.nationalmap.nicta.com.au/images/NCI.svg'/></center><br/><center><img style='padding: 10px' height='100px' src='/proxy/_1s/http://static.nationalmap.nicta.com.au/images/GA.jpg'/><img style='padding: 10px' height='100px' src='/proxy/_1s/http://static.nationalmap.nicta.com.au/images/DoEE.png'/></center>",

The slanted InSAR line-of-sight viewing geometry is insensitive to the north-south direction.\nNegative signals indicate either downward (in up-down products) or westward (in east-west products) surface movements.\nUncertainties of each product result from error propagation of initial line-of-sight data uncertainties during the data combination step.\nThe InSAR processing method used to create these products only uses high-quality pixels with very little signal noise. The resulting products are sparse in some areas (particularly highly vegetated areas) but have a high accuracy as demonstrated by validation with GPS data described in the GA Record. Different InSAR processing methods could be used to retrieve a denser coverage of displacement and velocity observations, but with reduced accuracy.\nALOS products generally have denser spatial coverage than Envisat and Radarsat-2 products. This is because ALOS uses a longer radar wavelength (~24 cm) than Envisat and Radarsat-2 (~6 cm) which enables the radar to better penetrate vegetation.\nA full description of the project and methods used to derive these InSAR products is given in the associated GA Record."

POI features for this service are primarily derived from features maintained within the Digital Topographic Database (DTDB). The POI feature class is maintained programmatically (automated) by sourcing spatial and aspatial attributes from other feature classes in the DTDB that contain POI features. The midpoint of a line or polygon features is used to define the POI. Points of Interest include features related to Community, Education, Recreation, Transportation, Utility, or Hydrography, Physiography and Place, and defined as a place with a prescribed name. The attribute information for an individual dataset may have been thinned or modifed to cater for the service. The service is available in a cached environment only. This dataset is compliant with the NSW FSDF and its specifications.
