Climatologies of daily exposure are given as an annual average and as a set of twelve monthly averages. Climatologies of the diurnal cycle are given as monthly averages of hourly exposures through the day.\n\nThese data sets are derived from 23 years (1990 - 2012) of data from satellites operated by Japan Meteorological Agency and the US National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration.",

The framework uses a maturity model approach outlining the various degrees of conformity.\n\nSpecific principles in the framework include the following:\n\n<ul><li>Environmental data are made publicly available through machine-readable web data services (published online).</li><li>Structured metadata will support any NEII data release (well described).</li><li>Providers will make their data available under an open licence.</li><li>Data are provided with support structures that provide enduring operational support to users.</li></ul>\n\nThe first principle is mandatory and in the absence of the availability of environmental data through web data services, NEII conformance is not possible at any level of maturity.\n\nSee the [NEII Conformance Framework](http://www.neii.gov.au/system/files/filedepot/1/NEII%20Conformance%20Framework%20Version%201.0%20May%202016.pdf) for a detailed overview of what constitutes conformance.\n\nSee [here]( http://www.neii.gov.au/web-data-services/) for a list of NEII conformant web data services and how to access.",
