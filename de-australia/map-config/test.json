All user interface features of the DEA Map are either obvious from the interface or are described in this “Help”.\nThe Map has been carefully designed to be as easy to use as possible. Our user experience design team run regular usability testing sessions, the results of which are then assessed for inclusion in releases.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhat browsers work with DEA Map?\n</summary>\nIt is best to use a browser with WebGL support such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 11. It will also work in some older browsers (for example IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited. It may not support 3D rendering of maps, so the **3D Terrain** option may show the same result as **3D Smooth**.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhat types are spatial data are displayed by DEA Map?\n</summary>\nThere are three types of spatial data which are read from the data sources and displayed by DEA Map over its base maps:\n\n**Point Click** on any point to see more information about that particular point feature.\n\n**Line Click** on any line to see more information about that particular line feature.\n\n**Region Click** within any region to see more information about that region.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy do \"3D Terrain\" and \"3D Smooth\" Perspective Views look the same on my computer?\n</summary>\nSome older computers do not have graphics cards which fully support WebGL and some older browsers do not make use of this support even if it is present. The DEA Map requires this support in order to support 3D Terrain Perspective View.\n\nTry upgrading your browser to the latest version. If that still does not work, you may need to consider working on a computer that has more recent graphics support.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy does the terrain in my perspective view have two different hues?\n</summary>\nDEA Map automatically changes the content of the map according to the scale at which you're viewing. If you zoom in it shows more detail. At some points in the zoom range, the map display switches from high altitude photography to lower altitude photography. These sets of the photography are not colour matched to each other, so may have quite different hues. The actual photography scales used, the date of that photography and its lighting conditions will vary across Australia.\nWhen you are using Perspective View the part of the terrain nearest to the \"camera position\" is naturally shown at a larger scale than the more distant parts. Depending on your zoom level, this can result in the foreground being displayed with a different set of photography from the distant parts of your Perspective View.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nHow can I save my current data selection and view?\n</summary>\n1. Select the datasets that you would like to save. Adjust the view to the desired view.\n2. Create a share URL by clicking the \"Share / Print\" button at the top right.\n3. Copy the generated share URL and email the URL to yourself, or save it in Favourites.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nI need more help to use the DEA Map. Who can I ask?\n</summary>\nSend your question to the DEA Map support email address, which is <insertemail@example.com>  or use the Feedback functionality at the bottom right corner of the map.\n\n</details>\n\n## DEA Map System and Data\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhere does the spatial data come from??\n</summary>\nIn most cases the spatial data being displayed is coming straight from the various data custodians included in the platform. For some datasets which are not available in a format possible to display on the map, these have been transformed and are hosted by DEA Map with the data custodians’ permission. You can see details of the department or agency that provides the spatial data by clicking About this data in the Data Workbench.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nThe data I was using are now gone. Where did they go?\n</summary>\nThe spatial data displayed by the DEA Map are referenced directly from the supplying department or agency by the DEA Map server. If that supplying department or agency updates or removes any data, that change will be reflected immediately by the DEA Map.\n\nIf you have any questions about the spatial data, you will need to contact the supplying department or agency.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhat can I do if I encounter errors when I try to add data to my workbench?\n</summary>\nWith DEA Map application harvesting data from various custodians in real time, it is highly dependent on the reliability of those services. There are many types of errors which can be encountered when data is selected:\n\n- Dataset hangs and possibly freezes the screen - that is because the application in your browser is trying to show an unusually large file.\n\n- 404, 500, 501, 503 etc. and other common errors which mean data services are not available due to server hosting those datasets temporarily having issues.\n\n- Dataset doesn't hang, no error message is displayed, but it doesn't show on the map.\n\nWhat you can do:\n\n- Come back to the dataset later (it might have been a temporary outage of the custodian server).\n\n- Refresh the view and clear the cache (i.e. \"browsing history\").\n\n- When there is no visible error, try first \"zoom to extent\" functionality or just zoom in very closely (under 100m) into an area of interest and wait for the app to \"load\" the images. Monitor the \"loading\" through the \"load progress bar\" at the very top of the map.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhere do the base maps come from?\n</summary>\nThe base maps displayed by the DEA Map come from a number of difference sources including Microsoft’s Bing, Geoscience Australia and NASA. They are downloaded from the source as they are required, so they are as up to date as that service provides.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy are location / address labels incorrectly positioned?\n</summary>\nLocations/addresses are part of the base maps provided by Bing Maps, Geoscience Australia, NASA and OpenStreet Maps. The DEA Map is dependent on those providers updates. For example, Bing Maps updated the Australian maps in February 2017: https://blogs.bing.com/maps/February-2017/New-Imagery-Released-Covering-Australia-and-India. For correcting those location errors, users have to address them directly to the base maps providers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWho developed the DEA Map?\n</summary>\nThe DEA Map was developed by Data61 in collaboration with the Australian Government. See the (About)[https://map.drought.gov.au/about.html] page from more information.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWho owns the spatial data on DEA Map? Can I use it and distribute it?\n</summary>\nBefore distributing any data from the DEA Map it is important to understand the licence restriction for the data. All Data Sets displayed by the DEA Map are the property of the department or agency which has provided them.\n\nTherefore the restrictions for each Data Set may be quite different.\nThe licence which governs the usage and distribution restrictions for each Data Set is shown in the About this data for the Data Set. To Display this information click on the title of your preferred data set in the Data Catalogue.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nHow reliable is the spatial data on the DEA Map?\n</summary>\nThe reliability will vary between data sets. To understand the reliability of a particular data set, click on the title of the data set in question in the Data Catalogue for more information. The metadata which is shown in the Data Catalogue may offer sufficient information or you may need to contact the listed data provider.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy can I see the whole world on the DEA Map?\n</summary>\nMost of the DEA Map base maps are provided by services for the whole world. There is no value in suppressing the display of the rest of the world, so you can view it if you wish. (Take a look at Mt Everest or the Grand Canyon in perspective view - they’re cool!)\n\nObviously, the DEA Map data does not cover the rest of the world!\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWill more data sets be added to the DEA Map?\n</summary>\nThat depends on the supplying departments or agencies, who must make the data available and the Drought Taskforce and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet teams currently managing the application. \n</details>\n\n## Reporting issues and providing feedback\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nI think I've found a bug. How do I report it?\n</summary>\nEmail us on info@terria.io to report the problem. Be sure to include a step by step description of how to reproduce the problem.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nI'd love a new feature. Can I suggest it?\n</summary>\nAbsolutely! Just email your suggestion to insertemail@example.com or use the Feedback functionality at the bottom right corner of the map. \n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nI think there’s an error in some data. How can I find out if it’s correct or report the problem? \n</summary>\nYou will need to refer to the department or agency which provides the Data Set which contains the issue.\nClick on the title of your preferred data set in the Data Catalogue to find out which department or agency provides that data.\n</details>\n",

          "content": "\n# Help\n\n## Get started\n\nTo launch DEA Map and display basic data:\n\n-   Display the DEA Map by using the URL [https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/).\n-   In the left hand panel click the **Add Data** button to launch the data \\\\catalogue.\n-   Browse through the data catalogue to find a data set of interest.\n-   Click on the title of your prefered data set to get a preview of that data, along with a description and other relevent metadata.\n-   To view your selected data set on a larger map, click the **Add to the Map** button. The spatial data will be immediately displayed in the map view, and a visual legend for that data will appear in the Data Workbench, located on the left hand side of the page.\n-   It may not be immediately obvious where your selected spatial data has loaded on the map if does not cover a large part of Australia. To locate loaded data on the map, go to the Data Workbench (positioned on the left hand side of the page), and click the **Zoom to extent** link for your desired data set. From here you can also click **About this data** to get more information about your selected data set.\n-   To add additional data sets to the map, simply click **Add Data** again in the left hand panel to relaunch the Data Catalogue.\n-   Zoom manually by moving your mouse pointer over the map and using your mouse wheel to zoom in or out further.\n-   Click and drag the map to further show the region in which you are interested.\n-   Click on a feature (that is, directly on a point or line, or within a region) to show data about the individual feature.\n\nYou can perform these steps in any order as required to tune your display of spatial data.\n\n## A displayed feature\n\nClick on the feature which is displayed on the map. You can click on points, on lines or within regions to see a display of the information available from the spatial data provider for that particular feature.\n\nFor points and lines, you need to click quite accurately to identify the feature. For regions, clicking on the boundary will give ambiguous results. Click within the region.\n\n## Display your own spreadsheet or spatial data\n\nDEA Maps can display two kinds of spreadsheets:\n\n1.  Spreadsheets with a **point location (latitude and longitude)** for each row, expressed as two columns: `lat` and `lon`. These will be displayed as points (circles).\n2.  Spreadsheets where each row refers to a **region** such as a local government area (council), state, postcode, or ABS statistical unit such as an SA2 or CED (Commonwealth Electoral Division). Columns must be named according to the [CSV-geo-au](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au) standard. These will be displayed as regions, highlighting the actual shape of each area.\n\nSpreadsheets must be saved as CSV (comma-separated values).\n\nOther standard spatial data types such as GeoJSON and KML are also supported.\n\nThere are two ways to load your data:\n\n-   Drag your data file onto the NationalMap map view. The format of the data file will be auto-detected.\n-   Click on the **Add Data** button in the left hand panel. This will launch the Data Catalogue. Select the **My Data** tab at the top of the modal window and follow the provided instructions.\n\nYou can click on the regions or points to see the data available for that location. If the file is a CSV file, the data from all columns will be shown in the feature information dialogue when you click.\n\nYou can also use all of the features of the [Data Workbench](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/help/data-workbench.html) on the data you have loaded as well.\n\nTo share a view of your data with others, you must first publish it to the web somewhere with a URL, and then load it from there.\n\n## Share my DEA Map view with others\n\nThere are three ways:\n\n-   Click the Share button, copy the given URL (shown in the first text box) to the clipboard and paste it into an email which you send to the recipient. They can click on it in the email or paste it into their browser to see the same view as you.\n-   Click the Share button, copy the HTML fragment (shown in the second text box) and paste it into an HTML file, which you then make available to the recipients. When the recipients display your web page, they will see the DEA Maps view within that web page.\n-   Take a screenshot and email it as an image (see your OS instructions on how to take a screenshot). This will share all information, even if loaded from a local file or URL.\n\n**Note that only the third method will show the data you have loaded from a local file**.\n\n## Contribute datasets to DEA Maps\n\nDEA Maps encourages data providers to publish their spatial data using this platform.\n\nIf you require your dataset to appear under a separate category of the DEA Maps Data Catalogue, contact the support for DEA Maps at dea@ga.gov.au. You will need to provide an internet accessible service in a standard protocol to access your dataset on the internet and appropriate references must be added to the DEA Maps configuration.\n\nYou can also signup to receive DEA updates by emailing dea@ga.gov.au.\n",

Identify the share URL which causes a notification of share preservation effort when loading them into Terria. e.g. you may know where they are embedded, or come across them accidentally\n2. Open them in the newer (v8) based map application \n3. Check that everything is sharing as you expect, tweak the layers to fit if some are missing or not behaving correctly.\n4. Update the share link by clicking the Share/Print button and copy the new link\n5. If distribution of share link is known, update the url in your web page (if embedded), or send the new link to users \n\n#### Consumers\n1. Load the share URL\n2. If it doesn't quite look right, notify the provider so they can follow the above steps to recreate it in the latest version of Terria",
