It will also work in some older browsers (for example IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited. It may not support 3D rendering of maps, so the **3D Terrain** option may show the same result as **3D Smooth**.\n</details>\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>\n  What types of spatial data are displayed by DE Africa Map?\n  </summary>\n\n  There are three types of spatial data which are read from the data sources and displayed by DE Africa Map over its base maps:\n\n  **Point Click** on any point to see more information about that particular point feature.\n\n  **Line Click** on any line to see more information about that particular line feature.\n\n  **Region Click** within any region to see more information about that region.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Why do \"3D Terrain\" and \"3D Smooth\" Perspective Views look the same on my computer?\n  </summary>\n\n  Some older computers do not have graphics cards which fully support WebGL and some older browsers do not make use of this support even if it is present. The DE Africa Map requires this support in order to support 3D Terrain Perspective View.\n\n  Try upgrading your browser to the latest version. If that still does not work, you may need to consider working on a computer that has more recent graphics support.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Why does the terrain in my perspective view have two different hues?\n  </summary>\n\n  DE Africa Map automatically changes the content of the map according to the scale at which you're viewing. If you zoom in it shows more detail. At some points in the zoom range, the map display switches from high altitude photography to lower altitude photography. These sets of the photography are not colour matched to each other, so may have quite different hues. The actual photography scales used, the date of that photography and its lighting conditions will vary across Australia.\n\n  When you are using Perspective View the part of the terrain nearest to the \"camera position\" is naturally shown at a larger scale than the more distant parts. Depending on your zoom level, this can result in the foreground being displayed with a different set of photography from the distant parts of your Perspective View.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  How can I save my current data selection and view?\n  </summary>\n\n  1. Select the datasets that you would like to save. Adjust the view to the desired view.\n\n  2. Create a share URL by clicking the \"Share / Print\" button at the top right.\n\n  3. Copy the generated share URL and email the URL to yourself, or save it in Favourites.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  I need more help to use the DE Africa Map. Who can I ask?\n  </summary>\n  \n  Send your question to [earth.observation@ga.gov.au](mailto:earth.observation@ga.gov.au).\n\n</details>\n\n## DE Africa Map System and Data\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Where does the spatial data come from?\n  </summary>\n\n  The spatial data displayed by the DE Africa Map is sourced from a range of organisations.\n\n  You can see details of the department or agency that provides the spatial data by clicking **About this data** in the data workbench.\n\n  </details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  The data I was using are now gone. Where did they go?\n  </summary>\n\n  The spatial data displayed by the DE Africa Map are referenced directly from the supplying department or agency by the DE Africa Map server. If that supplying department or agency updates or removes any data, that change will be reflected immediately by the DE Africa Map.\n\n  If you have any questions about the spatial data, you will need to contact the supplying department or agency.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Where do the base maps come from?\n  </summary>\n\n  The base maps displayed by the DE Africa Map come from a number of difference sources including Microsoft’s Bing, Geoscience Australia, Esri and NASA. They are downloaded from the source as they are required, so they are as up to date as that service provides.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Who developed the DE Africa Map?\n  </summary>\n  \n  The DE Africa Map was developed by [Data61](http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/D61), working closely with Geoscience Australia. See the About page for more information.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Who owns the spatial data on DE Africa Map? Can I use it and distribute it?\n  </summary>\n\n  Before distributing any data from DE Africa Map it is important to understand the licence restriction for the data. All data sets displayed by the DE Africa Map are the property of the department or agency which has provided them.\n\n  The licence which governs the usage and distribution restrictions for each data set is shown in catalogue.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  How reliable is the spatial data on the DE Africa Map?\n  </summary>\n\n  The reliability will vary between data sets. To understand the reliability of a particular data set, click on the title of the data set in question in the Data Catalogue for more information. The metadata which is shown in the Data Catalogue may offer sufficient information or you may need to contact the listed data provider.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Why can I see the whole world on the DE Africa Map?\n  </summary>\n  Most of the DE Africa Map base maps are provided by services for the whole world. There is no value in suppressing the display of the rest of the world, so you can view it if you wish.\n\n  The DE Africa Map's spatial data does not cover the rest of the world.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Will more data sets be added to DE Africa Map?\n  </summary>\n  \n  DE Africa is making products available based on the needs of African countries. For more information visit digitalearthafrica.org.\n\n</details>\n\n## Reporting issues and providing feedback\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  I think I've found a bug. How do I report it?\n  </summary>\n  \n  Email [earth.observation@ga.gov.au](mailto:earth.observation@ga.gov.au) to report the problem. Be sure to include a step by step description of how to reproduce the problem.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  I'd love a new feature. Can I suggest it?\n  </summary>\n  \n  Email your suggestion to [earth.observation@ga.gov.au](mailto:earth.observation@ga.gov.au)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  I think there’s an error in some data.

            "content": "\n# Help & FAQ\n\n## Get started\n\nTo launch the DE Africa Map and display some basic data follow these steps.\n\n-   Launch the DE Africa Map at [maps.digitalearth.africa](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/).\n-   In the left hand panel select **Explore data** to open the data catalogue (see image below).\n-   Find a dataset of interest such as water.\n-   Select the dataset to see a preview of that data and description.\n-   To view your selected dataset on the map, select **Add to the map**.\n![Data Catalogue](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/DataCatalogue.jpg)\n\nVisualise and analyse your dataset:\n\n-   The spatial data will be displayed in the map view, and a visual legend will appear in the Data workbench, on the left hand side of the page.\n-   It may not be immediately obvious where your selected spatial data has loaded on the map if it does not cover a large part of Africa. To locate loaded data on the map, go to the workbench, and select**Zoom to extent**.\n-   The datasets will be feature on the map view.\n-   To add additional datasets to the map, repeat the above steps.\n-   Zoom manually by moving your mouse pointer over the map and using your mouse wheel to zoom in or out further.\n-   Click and drag the map to further show the region in which you are interested.\n\n## Explore the workbench\n\n![Workbench](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Workbench.jpg)\n\nWhen a dataset is added to the map via the data catalogue, a legend for that dataset will appear in the workbench. From the workbench you can:\n\n-   Set the order data is shown on the map. To do this, select the title of a dataset and drag it to a new position in your workbench\n-   Toggle the visibility of added datasets by selecting the checkbox opposite your prefered data set title\n-   Zoom to the geographical extent of an added data set\n-   Set the opacity of individual data sets\n-   Remove data sets from the map. Note: they can be re-added via the data catalogue.\n\n## Navigate the map\n\n![Navigate](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Navigate.jpg)\n\nThere are multiple ways to navigate DE Africa Map's map view:\n\n### Zooming\n\nMove your mouse pointer over the map and use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out. The location at the centre of the map display is the centre of the zooming. Right-click and drag upwards or downwards over the map to zoom about the centre point. Select the zoom control to zoom in or out quickly by a set amount.\n\n### Panning\n\nClick anywhere on the map and drag it to the required location.\n\n### Rotate the map\n\nUse the compass control to rotate the map so North is no longer at the top. Select the “gyroscope” in the centre of the compass control and drag slowly to the left or right to rotate the map clockwise or anti-clockwise respectively. The further you drag, the faster it rotates. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired rotation.\n\nSelect the North Point or outer ring of the **Compass Control** and drag it around to set the desired rotation directly.\n\n**Control + left-click** and **drag** left or right over the map to rotate the view about the centre.\n\n### Perspective view\n\nSelect the “gyroscope” in the centre of the **compass control** and drag slowly upwards to tilt the view into a **perspective view**. Drag downwards to tilt the view back to vertical. The further you drag, the faster it tilts. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired view.\n\n**Control + left-click** and drag upwards or downwards over the map to enter or adjust the perspective view.\n\nWhen you are in perspective view, **control + left-click** and **drag** left or right over the map to “orbit” around the centre of the view. You can also click and drag left or right over the “gyroscope” at the centre of the Compass Control to orbit about the centre of the view.\n\n**Double-click** the “gyroscope” in the centre of the **Compass Control** to return the view quickly to a vertical view with North to the top at the current location and scale.\n\nDragging to pan and using the mouse wheel to zoom still work while showing a perspective view.\n\n## Change the basemap\n\n![Base maps](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Basemaps.jpg)\n\nSelect the Map button in the top right of the screen:\n\n-   Select **2D** to show a vertical map view with north to the top. The Compass Control will not be displayed and Perspective View cannot be enabled.\n-   Select **3D Smooth** to show a Perspective View which has no elevation change. The maps or images are draped over a smooth globe.\n-   Select **3D Terrain** to show a Perspective View which shows the elevation changes in the terrain. **3D Smooth** and **3D Terrain** will look almost the same unless you are using Perspective View.\n-   Click on one of the Base map thumbnails to select the type of map to view. Mouse over the thumbnails to see a hint on what they are.\n\n## Find out about a displayed feature\n\nWhen you have identified a region and available dataset, it will feature on the map view. To find out more information you can click on points, lines or within regions to display the feature information available from the spatial data provider for that particular feature.\n\nFor points and lines, you need to click quite accurately to identify the feature. For regions, clicking on the boundary will give ambiguous results. Click within the region.\n\n## Use the splitter functionality\n\nThe splitter functionality allows you to compare a dataset for different time periods. To use it:\n\n-   Select an area/location\n-   Select a dataset from the catalogue to add it to the workbench\n-   Select the **Split** link in the workbench to create a copy of the data already selected. Note that you can use the splitter with two different datasets, not just with copies of the same data\n-   Select different times (using the date picker) for the “left” and “right” sections of the screen\n-   Use the back and forward arrows to explore imagery and select cloud-free views\n-   Drag the splitter on the screen to observe the differences\n\n## Download data from the map\n\nThere are two types of download:\n\n-   **Raw data:** Once a dataset has been selected, select About this data, then scroll down to the Data URL. Data download depends entirely on custodians making it available. Should the raw files not be available, users need to contact custodians directly; their details are available under Data Custodian or Service Contact, on the same page.\n-   **Feature information:** Once a point or a polygon on the map is selected and the Feature Information window is shown, you can download the data in that particular feature info window, by scrolling down and clicking on Download this Table, in CSV or JSON. It will just download the feature info table, not the raw data.\n\n## Upload data to the map\n\nThere are two ways to load your data:\n\n-   Drag your data file onto the DE Africa Map map view. The format of the data file will be auto-detected.\n-   Select **Explore data** in the left hand panel. This will launch the data catalogue. Select the **My data** tab at the top of the modal window and follow the provided instructions.\n\nAs for DE Africa Map data sets, you can select regions or points to see the data available for that location. If the file is a CSV file, the data from all columns will be shown in the feature information dialogue.\n\nYou can also use all of the features of the workbench on the data you have loaded as well.\n\nTo share a view of your data with others, you must first publish it to the web somewhere with a URL, and then load it from there.\n\nDE Africa Map can display two kinds of spreadsheets:\n\n1.  Spreadsheets with a **point location (latitude and longitude)** for each row, expressed as two columns: `lat` and `lon`. These will be displayed as points (circles).\n2.  Spreadsheets where each row refers to a **region** such as a local government area (council), state, postcode, or ABS statistical unit such as an SA2 or CED (Commonwealth Electoral Division). Columns must be named according to the [CSV-geo-au](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au) standard. These will be displayed as regions, highlighting the actual shape of each area.\n\nSpreadsheets must be saved as CSV (comma-separated values).\n\nOther standard spatial data types such as GeoJSON and KML are also supported.\n\n## Share with others\n\nThere are three ways to share your DE Africa Map view:\n\n1.  Select the Share button, copy the given URL (shown in the first text box) to the clipboard and paste it into an email which you send to the recipient.\n2.  Select the Share button, copy the HTML fragment (shown in the second text box) and paste it into an HTML file, which you then make available to the recipients. When the recipients display your web page, they will see the DE Africa Map view within that web page.\n3.  Click the Share button and simply use the Print Preview and Print.\n4.  Take a screenshot and email it as an image (see your OS instructions on how to take a screenshot). This will share all information, even if loaded from a local file or URL.\n\n**Note that only the third and fourth methods will show the data you have loaded from a local file**.",

Cela fonctionnera également dans certains navigateurs plus anciens (par exemple IE9 et IE10) mais le le rendu de la carte sera limité. Il peut ne pas prendre en charge le rendu 3D des cartes, donc l'option **Terrain 3D** peut afficher le même résultat que **3D Smooth**.\n</details>\n\n  <details>\n  <summary>\n  Quels types de données spatiales peuvent être lues par DE Africa Map ?\n  </summary>\n\n  Il existe trois types de données spatiales qui sont lues à partir des sources de données et affichées par DE Africa Map sur ses cartes de base:\n\n  **Point Click** sur n'importe quel point pour voir plus d'informations sur cette caractéristique ponctuelle particulière.\n\n  **Ligne Cliquez** sur n'importe quelle ligne pour afficher plus d'informations sur cette caractéristique de ligne particulière.\n\n  **Région Cliquez** dans n'importe quelle région pour voir plus d'informations sur cette région.\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Pourquoi les vues en perspective « Terrain 3D » et « Lisse 3D » se ressemblent-elles sur mon ordinateur ?\n  </summary>\n\n  Certains ordinateurs plus anciens n'ont pas de cartes graphiques qui prennent entièrement en charge WebGL et certains navigateurs plus anciens n'utilisent pas cette prise en charge même si elle est présente. DE Africa Maps de DE Africa nécessite ce support afin de prendre en charge la vue en perspective du terrain 3D.\n\n  Essayez de mettre à jour votre navigateur vers la dernière version. Si cela ne fonctionne toujours pas, vous devrez peut-être envisager de travailler sur un ordinateur doté d'une prise en charge graphique plus récente.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Pourquoi le terrain dans ma vue en perspective a-t-il deux teintes différentes ?\n  </summary>\n\n  DE Africa Map modifie automatiquement le contenu de la carte en fonction de l'échelle à laquelle vous la visualisez. Si vous zoomez, cela montre plus de détails. À certains points de la plage de zoom, l'affichage de la carte passe de la photographie à haute altitude à la photographie à basse altitude. Ces ensembles de photographies ne sont pas assortis les uns aux autres, ils peuvent donc avoir des teintes assez différentes. Les échelles de photographie réelles utilisées, la date de cette photographie et ses conditions d'éclairage varient à travers l'Afrique.\n\n  Lorsque vous utilisez la vue en perspective, la partie du terrain la plus proche de la \"position de la caméra\" est naturellement affichée à une plus grande échelle que les parties les plus éloignées. Selon votre niveau de zoom, cela peut entraîner l'affichage du premier plan avec un ensemble de photographies différent des parties éloignées de votre vue en perspective.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  Comment puis-je enregistrer ma sélection et mon affichage de données actuels ?\n  </summary>\n\n  1. Sélectionnez les ensembles de données que vous souhaitez enregistrer. Ajustez la vue à la vue souhaitée.\n\n  2. Créez une URL de partage en cliquant sur le bouton \"Partager / Imprimer\" en haut à droite.\n\n  3. Copiez l'URL de partage générée et envoyez-vous l'URL par e-mail ou enregistrez-la dans les favoris.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n  J'ai besoin de plus d'aide pour utiliser Maps.

It will also work in some older browsers (for example IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited. It may not support 3D rendering of maps, so the&nbsp;</span><strong>3D Terrain</strong><span>&nbsp;option may show the same result as&nbsp;</span><strong>3D Smooth</strong><span>.</span></p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhat types of spatial data are displayed by DE Africa Map?\n</summary>\nThere are three types of spatial data which are read from the data sources and displayed by DE Africa Map over its base maps:\n\n**Point Click** on any point to see more information about that particular point feature.\n\n**Line Click** on any line to see more information about that particular line feature.\n\n**Region Click** within any region to see more information about that region.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy do \"3D Terrain\" and \"3D Smooth\" Perspective Views look the same on my computer?\n</summary>\nSome older computers do not have graphics cards which fully support WebGL and some older browsers do not make use of this support even if it is present. The DE Africa Map requires this support in order to support 3D Terrain Perspective View.\n\nTry upgrading your browser to the latest version. If that still does not work, you may need to consider working on a computer that has more recent graphics support.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nWhy does the terrain in my perspective view have two different hues?\n</summary>\nDE Africa Map automatically changes the content of the map according to the scale at which you're viewing. If you zoom in it shows more detail. At some points in the zoom range, the map display switches from high altitude photography to lower altitude photography. These sets of the photography are not colour matched to each other, so may have quite different hues. The actual photography scales used, the date of that photography and its lighting conditions will vary across Australia.\nWhen you are using Perspective View the part of the terrain nearest to the \"camera position\" is naturally shown at a larger scale than the more distant parts. Depending on your zoom level, this can result in the foreground being displayed with a different set of photography from the distant parts of your Perspective View.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nHow can I save my current data selection and view?\n</summary>\n1. Select the datasets that you would like to save. Adjust the view to the desired view.\n2. Create a share URL by clicking the \"Share / Print\" button at the top right.\n3.

          "content": "\n# Help & FAQ\n\n## Get started\n\nTo launch the DE Africa Map and display some basic data follow these steps.\n\n-   Launch the DE Africa Map at [maps.digitalearth.africa](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/).\n-   In the left hand panel select **Explore data** to open the data catalogue (see image below).\n-   Find a dataset of interest such as water.\n-   Select the dataset to see a preview of that data and description.\n-   To view your selected dataset on the map, select **Add to the map**.\n![Data Catalogue](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/DataCatalogue.jpg)\n\nVisualise and analyse your dataset:\n\n-   The spatial data will be displayed in the map view, and a visual legend will appear in the Data workbench, on the left hand side of the page.\n-   It may not be immediately obvious where your selected spatial data has loaded on the map if it does not cover a large part of Africa. To locate loaded data on the map, go to the workbench, and select**Zoom to extent**.\n-   The datasets will be feature on the map view.\n-   To add additional datasets to the map, repeat the above steps.\n-   Zoom manually by moving your mouse pointer over the map and using your mouse wheel to zoom in or out further.\n-   Click and drag the map to further show the region in which you are interested.\n\n## Explore the workbench\n\n![Workbench](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Workbench.jpg)\n\nWhen a dataset is added to the map via the data catalogue, a legend for that dataset will appear in the workbench. From the workbench you can:\n\n-   Set the order data is shown on the map. To do this, select the title of a dataset and drag it to a new position in your workbench\n-   Toggle the visibility of added datasets by selecting the checkbox opposite your prefered data set title\n-   Zoom to the geographical extent of an added data set\n-   Set the opacity of individual data sets\n-   Remove data sets from the map. Note: they can be re-added via the data catalogue.\n\n## Navigate the map\n\n![Navigate](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Navigate.jpg)\n\nThere are multiple ways to navigate DE Africa Map's map view:\n\n### Zooming\n\nMove your mouse pointer over the map and use the scroll wheel to zoom in or out. The location at the centre of the map display is the centre of the zooming. Right-click and drag upwards or downwards over the map to zoom about the centre point. Select the zoom control to zoom in or out quickly by a set amount.\n\n### Panning\n\nClick anywhere on the map and drag it to the required location.\n\n### Rotate the map\n\nUse the compass control to rotate the map so North is no longer at the top. Select the “gyroscope” in the centre of the compass control and drag slowly to the left or right to rotate the map clockwise or anti-clockwise respectively. The further you drag, the faster it rotates. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired rotation.\n\nSelect the North Point or outer ring of the **Compass Control** and drag it around to set the desired rotation directly.\n\n**Control + left-click** and **drag** left or right over the map to rotate the view about the centre.\n\n### Perspective view\n\nSelect the “gyroscope” in the centre of the **compass control** and drag slowly upwards to tilt the view into a **perspective view**. Drag downwards to tilt the view back to vertical. The further you drag, the faster it tilts. Release the mouse button when you reach the desired view.\n\n**Control + left-click** and drag upwards or downwards over the map to enter or adjust the perspective view.\n\nWhen you are in perspective view, **control + left-click** and **drag** left or right over the map to “orbit” around the centre of the view. You can also click and drag left or right over the “gyroscope” at the centre of the Compass Control to orbit about the centre of the view.\n\n**Double-click** the “gyroscope” in the centre of the **Compass Control** to return the view quickly to a vertical view with North to the top at the current location and scale.\n\nDragging to pan and using the mouse wheel to zoom still work while showing a perspective view.\n\n## Change the basemap\n\n![Base maps](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/images/Basemaps.jpg)\n\nSelect the Map button in the top right of the screen:\n\n-   Select **2D** to show a vertical map view with north to the top. The Compass Control will not be displayed and Perspective View cannot be enabled.\n-   Select **3D Smooth** to show a Perspective View which has no elevation change. The maps or images are draped over a smooth globe.\n-   Select **3D Terrain** to show a Perspective View which shows the elevation changes in the terrain. **3D Smooth** and **3D Terrain** will look almost the same unless you are using Perspective View.\n-   Click on one of the Base map thumbnails to select the type of map to view. Mouse over the thumbnails to see a hint on what they are.\n\n## Find out about a displayed feature\n\nWhen you have identified a region and available dataset, it will feature on the map view. To find out more information you can click on points, lines or within regions to display the feature information available from the spatial data provider for that particular feature.\n\nFor points and lines, you need to click quite accurately to identify the feature. For regions, clicking on the boundary will give ambiguous results. Click within the region.\n\n## Use the splitter functionality\n\nThe splitter functionality allows you to compare a dataset for different time periods. To use it:\n\n-   Select an area/location\n-   Select a dataset from the catalogue to add it to the workbench\n-   Select the **Split** link in the workbench to create a copy of the data already selected. Note that you can use the splitter with two different datasets, not just with copies of the same data\n-   Select different times (using the date picker) for the “left” and “right” sections of the screen\n-   Use the back and forward arrows to explore imagery and select cloud-free views\n-   Drag the splitter on the screen to observe the differences\n\n## Download data from the map\n\nThere are two types of download:\n\n-   **Raw data:** Once a dataset has been selected, select About this data, then scroll down to the Data URL. Data download depends entirely on custodians making it available. Should the raw files not be available, users need to contact custodians directly; their details are available under Data Custodian or Service Contact, on the same page.\n-   **Feature information:** Once a point or a polygon on the map is selected and the Feature Information window is shown, you can download the data in that particular feature info window, by scrolling down and clicking on Download this Table, in CSV or JSON. It will just download the feature info table, not the raw data.\n\n## Upload data to the map\n\nThere are two ways to load your data:\n\n-   Drag your data file onto the DE Africa Map map view. The format of the data file will be auto-detected.\n-   Select **Explore data** in the left hand panel. This will launch the data catalogue. Select the **My data** tab at the top of the modal window and follow the provided instructions.\n\nAs for DE Africa Map data sets, you can select regions or points to see the data available for that location. If the file is a CSV file, the data from all columns will be shown in the feature information dialogue.\n\nYou can also use all of the features of the workbench on the data you have loaded as well.\n\nTo share a view of your data with others, you must first publish it to the web somewhere with a URL, and then load it from there.\n\nDE Africa Map can display two kinds of spreadsheets:\n\n1.  Spreadsheets with a **point location (latitude and longitude)** for each row, expressed as two columns: `lat` and `lon`. These will be displayed as points (circles).\n2.  Spreadsheets where each row refers to a **region** such as a local government area (council), state, postcode, or ABS statistical unit such as an SA2 or CED (Commonwealth Electoral Division). Columns must be named according to the [CSV-geo-au](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au) standard. These will be displayed as regions, highlighting the actual shape of each area.\n\nSpreadsheets must be saved as CSV (comma-separated values).\n\nOther standard spatial data types such as GeoJSON and KML are also supported.\n\n## Share with others\n\nThere are three ways to share your DE Africa Map view:\n\n1.  Select the Share button, copy the given URL (shown in the first text box) to the clipboard and paste it into an email which you send to the recipient.\n2.  Select the Share button, copy the HTML fragment (shown in the second text box) and paste it into an HTML file, which you then make available to the recipients. When the recipients display your web page, they will see the DE Africa Map view within that web page.\n3.  Click the Share button and simply use the Print Preview and Print.\n4.  Take a screenshot and email it as an image (see your OS instructions on how to take a screenshot). This will share all information, even if loaded from a local file or URL.\n\n**Note that only the third and fourth methods will show the data you have loaded from a local file**.",

Through translating data into ready-to-use insights, more informed decisions about soil and coastal erosion, agriculture, deforestation,  desertification, water quality and changes to human settlements can be made. Learn more about DE AFrica at [digitalearthafrica.org](http://www.digitalearthafrica.org/).\n\nThe **DE Africa Map** aims to provide easy access to spatial information on the African continent to help increase an understanding of using satellite data for better decisions.\n\nThe **DE Africa Map** is a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you’re typically accessing the data directly from the department or agency who are the custodians.\n\nThe **DE Africa Map**:\n\n-   provides easy access to spatial data to government, business and the public\n-   facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies\n-   provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation\n\n## Use the DE Africa Map\n\nStart exploring the DE Africa Map at [maps.digitalearth.africa](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/). You can see what is available using the Explore data button to open the catalogue and expand a category you wish to browse. For specific instructions see our [Help and FAQs](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/help/help.html).\n\n## Contribute to the DE Africa Map\n\n**Data:** If you’re working on spatial datasets or producing them (such as CSVs with geolocation information) and you think they would be beneficial, you can contact the DE Africa Map product owner within Geoscience Australia and suggest inclusion in the Data Catalogue. The same process applies if you spot relevant spatial data on other applications, maps or websites: earthobservation@ga.gov.au.\n\n**TerriaJS software:** The DE Africa Map is powered by TerriaJS, an open source software published on GitHub. You can become a contributor to the code or simply suggest new features, by submitting an issue directly in the open repository. Make sure you give a detailed description of the use case for the new functionalities.\n\n## Understand the DE Africa Map software\n\nThe DE Africa Map is Open Source software available as a [Github project](https://github.com/TerriaJS/de-africa-map).
